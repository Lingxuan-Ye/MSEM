# Centralized Computing Service for Business

## Purpose

Computers are of great importance to all business companies. However, to those companies that are not in Information Technology industry, managing and maintaining office computer cluster is way harder than expected: because those computing devices are distributed to employees, the hardware/software maintenance is not guaranteed. Due to the sophisticated nature of computer and the ignorance of mass majority, office computers are frequently facing virus infections, business secret leaks, runtime environment conflicts, crashing and all other unexpected troubles. In fact, almost all companies have to set up a whole IT department with great cost to handle those problems, if and only if the problem is perceived by the user. This project mainly aims to provide a centralized computing service in order to reduce the occurrence of problems mentioned above and lower the cost of operations and maintenance.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to set up a centralized server locally with terminals distributed to every employees' office instead of distributing computers. Users (employees) can no longer get access to the hardware and their behaviors to the operating system are limited. Administrator can preinstall a list of software for business purpose and other software that user wishes to use can only run in a sandbox. This project also provides a series of supporting services. The project aims to serve all companies especially those with no intersection with information technology.

## Scope

The scope of the project is to provide a whole set of services including installation, operating system image procurement, virtual machine customization and distribution, operations engineering training and technical support.

## Funder/Investor

The investor for this project will be an angel investor looking to make a seed investment in company operation services. Since this project is relatively small scale and low-end, in the later stages of the project development, it is less likely to require to be funded. The whole funding lifecycle should end right after the demo being released. The end user of this project are the company owners who wish to reform the workflow of the company business for a better information security.

The companies will pay an upfront fee for the whole set of installation and a annual fee for technical support. It also requires to hire operations engineers of our project's own. In the later stages, a partnership will be formed with some educational institutions that will help training operations engineers from the company's IT department. The upfront fee should cover the hardware/software procurement fee, installation fee, our project's overhead and earning. The dividend of the investor will be paid for 5 years and after which all the equity will be repurchased.

For the end-users, their IT departments will no longer need to employ people interfacing with other departments. After the separation of computer using and maintaining, the departments inside the company are no longer high coupling, which dramatically reduces the communication cost.

## Technical Approach

The technical approach of this project will include the following modules.

### Installation

This module includes server host machine installation, cable installation, Input/Output devices (including mouse, keyboard, camera, microphone, monitor, etc.) integration. Those I/O devices are regarded as the server's terminal.

### Operation system configuring

Customize the operation system configuration in order to satisfy the company's own needs and make image of the operation system.

### Virtual machine deployment

Instantiate virtual machines for every employees from the highly customized image. Every employee should be assigned an individual virtual machine for work.

### Status monitoring

Monitor virtual machines' status and fix problems in time. Backup user documents periodically in case people make their machines crash.
