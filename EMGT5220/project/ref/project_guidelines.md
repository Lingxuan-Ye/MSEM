The Term Project is an exercise to apply the techniques and methodologies you learned in this course. It consists of several (required) Canvas Assignments, such as:

1. Project Proposal

1. Draft#1 Report

1. Draft#2 Report

1. Draft#3 Report

1. Project Report

1. Project Presentation

Each week you will have to spend time on the above items; most of your time will be spent on Draft Report submissions.

During the course, you will be provided with more details, explanations, and guidance of the next steps for your project. Drafts represent a formal snapshot of your work in progress at a cadence of 3 weeks. After completing one Draft, you are supposed to work to improve the contents for the next Draft to be submitted. You will receive extensive feedback during the classes and in form of notes on your Draft submissions.

Towards the end of the course, you use the final Project Report to create a Project Presentation. More details about the three items above follow.

## Project Proposal & Selection of Partner(s)

During the first week of classes, you select a project to work during the course. It can be a small project or large project; it can be something you want to do yourself or a project you want to do for a company. Regardless, the project may involve several real or fictitious people who work with you or work for you. Ideally, the project includes more than a dozen of technical contributors, and you play the role of the Project Manager for this.

You will also select one or more project partners to work together. Your partner will serve as a “sounding board” to discuss your project and their project – more of this in the next section.

You will start by creating a Project Proposal; think of this proposal to be a request for funding addressed to a business entity (a Government Agency, a Company, a Venture Firm, etc). With this proposal, you float an idea of a project which,

- It is novel & interesting

- Serves a good purpose

- It has a financial benefit to the business entity

Such proposal is short, typically not exceeding one or two pages. It consists of the following items:

1. A short, descriptive Title. Such title must be descriptive with no acronyms and easily understandable by the average business reader. Avoid specific or uncommon terms.

1. The Purpose of the project. This statement should refer to:

   1. What is the need the project fulfils?

   1. What is the problem that your project solves?

   1. What is unique and different?

   1. What is the benefit of this project?

1. The Objective of the project. You are doing this project to create something, either

   1. a “physical thing” or

   1. an “on-line service” or

   1. a “process for something”

   In all cases, because you are creating something “useful” and “needed”, users do get a benefit.

   The recipient of the project can be:

   1. an end-user who is willing to either pay for it or save money by using or owning this.

   1. an organization or company or government who will pay for it. They in turn, will sell it or provide it as a service to end-users.

   In this paragraph, you need to explain what it is, (a), (b) or (c) and who is the recipient i, or ii.

1. The Scope of the project refers to what you & your team will do and deliver at the end of the project – in high level terms.

   1. Do not describe the process you will follow.

   1. Do not describe the benefits or “goodness” of what you plan to do. (Such benefits could be mentioned in the Purpose of the project)

   1. Do describe what you and your team will actually do complete this project and accomplish partially or the entity of the Purpose in (2)

1. The Funder (aka Investor Stakeholder) of the project.

   1. Who will fund your project; be specific: an individual, a company, etc.

   1. Why should they invest? what will be their benefit in short and long term. How would their investment is multiplied by 4 or by 8 in a couple of years?

   1. Explain the flow of money from the end-user all the way back to the company sponsoring your project, back to the investors.

   Do keep in mind that any project requires money to be allocated and spent by you and your team. So, you need to convince someone that what you ate doing will yield back to them a profit.

1. The Technical Approach you plan to follow. This is about how you/your team will do the project.

   1. Refer at high-level (no details) to the systems/engineering/technical approach. Decompose the project to specific submodules.

   1. Mention any unique things or technologies you/your team will do.

   1. Can include mechanical, electrical, software, chemical or similar

   1. Do not include the processes or the “managerial approach” you will follow.

   1. Stick exclusively to the technical content not the process you will follow!!!

Format and mechanics:

1. The Project Proposal must be written in Word, using the default Word template.

1. Use either Times Roman 11pt or Arial 11pt; use single spaced lines

1. Titles of Sections must use “Heading 2” – paragraphs can use “Normal”

1. Submit the Project Proposal as a Canvas Assignment – the first draft is typically due 7 days after the first class.

1. You will have an opportunity to ask clarification questions during the first class.

## Project Report

After you create a Project Proposal you are ready to start creating the Project Report. This is a very iterative process: as you learn various project management techniques you will apply them to your project.

I will provide you constant feedback of areas of improvement; but my recommendations are not enough. You will need to choose another project partner to work together – there is nothing more valuable in project management than having a sounding board, another colleague to discuss your work! So, after you submit your proposal, I will post to the entire class your name, email address, project title and your engineering major. Then, you can contact either people you know, or someone you will get to know as your project partner. Both of you will cross-check and Zoom or Call to better your projects.

Format and mechanics:

- The Project Report must be written in Word, using the default Word template.

- Use either Times Roman 11pt or Arial 11pt; use single spaced lines

- Titles of Sections must use “Heading 2” – paragraphs can use “Normal”

- Subsections may use with Heading 3” or bolded “Normal”.

- Professional and well written Reports are essential, including

  1. Title Page

  1. Revision History

  1. Table of Contents -- hyperlinked

  1. Footers and Page numbers

  1. Figure and Table Captions

  1. Embedded links and references,

  1. All captures/tables/figures must be clearly readable

  1. etc

- Limited to 20-pages (but above 6-pages!)

- Use either Times Roman 11pt or Arial 11pt; use single spaced lines

For the Project Report you must use the Project Report Template included in the Common Module

Notes:

Do expect to:

- Work incrementally

- Create new sections

- Re-write previous sections

- Restructure sections

Do not expect to:

- you spend 3-5 days at once and you complete the Report!

- you know in advance what “exactly” you need to do & include.

Your own sense of composing a compelling Project Report will be put to work! It is not about meeting the minimum course requirements – it is about you to be proud of making a superb Report. Nevertheless, certain sections such as the WBS, Gantt Charts, FMEA etc will have to follow the formats we will discuss in the class.

## Project Presentation

The Project Presentation is “the elevator pitch” at the end of the Project. It is based on the Project Report, so the better the Report, the better the Presentation. It typically includes the high level summary of your project, such as:

1. Purpose & Objective – the overall Context of the Project

1. Scope – what you did

1. Technical Approach

1. Project Management Approach

The Project Presentation as a derivative of the Project Report must be consistent with it. All sections must be in plain English so your classmates can understand!

Format and Mechanics:

- Written in Powerpoint – 3-5 pages

- Will be presented to the Class by you; your allotted time will be 5-8 minutes

## Term Project Rubric

Project Proposals, and Project Report Drafts must be submitted but will not be graded – the purpose of submissions is for me to read them and provide you feedback for improvements. There will be only one grade for the Term Project to my discretion. The rubric for the final evaluation is as follows:

- Readability (10%): doc organization, conformance to template, intro per section, table/picture captions, page breaks/numbers, margins, etc.

- Charter (15%): Proper use of: Mind-mapping, Flow Diagrams, State diagrams, IDEF0, etc.

- Project Plan (25%): WBS, RACI, Gantt, PERT & Solution, Resource Loading & Balancing. Emphasis in consistency with Scope & Technical Approach

- Risk Management (15%): SWOT, FMEA, RPN, 3x3, Mitigation, Success Factors, Assumptions

- Submissions, Engagement, Feedback (15%)

- Clarity of Presentation (5%)

- Presentation content (10%): technical approach, consistency with report

Examples of past Project Reports and Presentations can be found in Canvas.
