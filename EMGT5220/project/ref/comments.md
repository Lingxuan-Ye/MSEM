- [x] Title: too generic. See my comments below, and after you define a clear Scope and Objective then you can improve the title.

- [x] Purpose: good

- [x] Objective: good but you can improve. Is your project creation of a web site? Are you going to provide “terminals”? What is a “terminal” and how it is connected to your service?

- [x] Scope: what you define here is NOT A PROJECT! It is an on-going service operation. Projects have a beginning and an end.

- [x] Funder: is OK

- [x] Technical Approach: is good, but needs to become specific to the project scope.

- [x] You did not take into account my previous comments on Scope. Is this project for one specific company or a generic process? Your Objective refers to multiple companies. Your technical approach is specific. Oops!

- [x] ORG: missing org chart. Marketing is not relevant – you also do not refer to mkt activities in the Scope.

- [x] WBS: poor because: (a) number of people per task is missing, (b) PM cannot be responsible for most of the tasks, (c) all tasks are cascaded, (d) you did not do the Mindmap before the WBS

- [x] RACI: poor because: (a) the same person cannot be responsible and accountable, (b) the PM always relies on Consultation, and always needs to Inform.

- [x] Budget: Ok for now. Since we have not covered the Gantt charts, the budget per month is premature.

- [x] MindMap: missing

- [x] Tool#1 missing

- [x] Tool#2 missing

- [x] Overall: below expectations for Draft#2. Please address the above feedback.

- [x] ORG: remains weak, per my previous comments
- [x] WBS: poor, per my previous comments
- [x] PERT (by hand): missing. Solving the network forward and backwards is beneficial.
- [x] Gantt: cannot read it. Include dependencies only on subtasks. I see multiple orphan tasks. If you had done the previous, you would have caught these. 
- [x] PERT (autocreated): similar problems as in Gantt. OK if it was compared with the hand generated. 
- [x] SWOT: Weaknesses are poor because they are generic and not specific to this project. Threat are a bit better. Labels can help.
- [x] RPN: good
- [x] Matrix: excellent
- [x] Mitigation plan: good
- [x] Financial: needs improvement because the timeline is not consistent with the Gantt.
- [x] CSF & Assumptions: highly inconsistent with the SWOT analysis. Why all these points which are good) are not a part of your SWOT analysis? The CSF & Assumptions should be derived from the SWOT. See Slide deck Class #6-about p42, Class #7-about p8
- [x] Overall: very good work for Draft#3. Keep it up. Please improve considering the above comments
