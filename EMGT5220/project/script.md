## Intro

Hello everyone, my name is Lingxuan Ye.

Today, I'm going to present my project â€” Centralized Alternative Solution for Enterprise Computing Needs.

## Problems

As we all know, computers are of great importance to all business companies. However, managing and maintaining office computer clusters can be a challenging task, especially for those companies that are not in the IT industry.

Employees may encounter frequent issues such as virus infections, business secret leaks, runtime environment conflicts, and crashing. These issues can lead to significant productivity loss and can be costly to address.

Additionally, setting up a fully-functioned IT department to handle these problems can be extremely expensive.

## Solution

To address these issues, we propose a centralized local server while only distributing virtual machines and terminals to each employee.

This solution limits user access to the hardware layer and main operating system, while providing a highly-customized tool chain for their daily work. 

Additionally, a sandbox environment will be available for users' own needs.

## Benefits

There are several benefits of our proposed solution.

Firstly, it enhances security by access restriction.

Secondly, it makes troubleshooting and maintenance more efficient, which can help companies save time and money. 

Thirdly, this approach can help lower communication costs since all virtual machines are visible for the  administrator.

Finally, it requires fewer IT staff.

## Technical Approach

As you can see, there are six modules of our project. I'm not going to talk about the details but just the summary.
